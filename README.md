## Overview

We propose a Position-guided Prompt learning method for Anomaly Detection in chest X-rays (PPAD). PPAD leverages learnable text prompt and image prompt to minimize the gap between pre-training data and task-specific data. Through the position-guided prompts, the model can focus on various regions, simulating the diagnostic process of experts.

Furthermore, we propose a Structure-preserving Anomaly Synthesis method (SAS) in the training phase.
