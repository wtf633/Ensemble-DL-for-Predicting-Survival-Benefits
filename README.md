## Overview

We developed an Ensemble-DL model using pre-treatment multiphase CT images to predict overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). Three additional machine learning models were built for comparison based on radiomic features, tumor size-based criteria, and established clinical risk factors. We assessed the Ensemble-DL signature's incremental predictive value compared to clinical risk factors and evaluated the model's interpretability.
